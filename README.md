# Stata Template

## Overview

This repository serves as a template for reproducible Stata projects, addressing three common challenges:

- **Project execution**: Scripts should never use `cd some/path` to change the working directory, as this breaks portability and will not work on other machines. Instead, Stata should always be launched from the project's root directory. The simplest approach is to place `main.do` in the root and open it directly. A more recent alternative is to use (*File → New → Project…*, e.g., `template-stata.stpr`), which opens Stata and automatically sets the correct working directory. Users may also manually set the working directory via the Stata GUI (*File → Change Working Directory…*).
- **Portability**: Relative file paths using forward slashes (`"/"`) allow the code to run on any system without modification. Backslashes (`"\"`) should be avoided, as they are only supported on Windows.
- **Dependencies**: The `setup.do` file documents how the [Stata environment](https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/22-reproducing-environments-stata.html) is configured and what is included in the package under the `ado` path.
- **Documentation**: The README follows the [Social Science Data Editors template](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/) (version 1.1) for standardized replication packages.

Addressing these challenges before submission significantly streamlines the review process, saving time and effort for both data editors and authors.

The template includes a working example that downloads FRED macroeconomic data and analyzes the relation between unemployment and inflation, producing one figure and one regression table.

### Summary of Availability

- [X] All data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Some data **cannot be made** publicly available.
- [ ] **No data can be made** publicly available.

### Details on each Data Source

#### Unemployment Rate Data

The unemployment rate data is downloaded from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The data series UNRATE contains the U.S. civilian unemployment rate as a percentage of the civilian labor force. 

- **Data source**: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED
- **Series ID**: UNRATE
- **URL**: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE
- **Access**: Public use, no registration required
- **Format**: CSV
- **License**: Public domain (U.S. government data)
- **Download method**: The code automatically downloads the data via the URL

#### Consumer Price Index Data

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) data is also sourced from FRED. This series represents the monthly CPI-U index for all items in the U.S. city average.

- **Data source**: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED
- **Series ID**: CPIAUCSL
- **URL**: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL
- **Access**: Public use, no registration required
- **Format**: CSV
- **License**: Public domain (U.S. government data)
- **Download method**: The code automatically downloads the data via the URL

### Dataset List

| Data file | Source | Notes | Provided |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| `data/raw/unemployment_rate.dta` | FRED UNRATE | Downloaded by code | Yes |
| `data/raw/cpi.dta` | FRED CPIAUCSL | Downloaded by code | Yes |
| `data/analysis/macro_data.dta` | Derived from above | Merged and processed data with calculated inflation rates | Yes |

## Computational Requirements

### Software Requirements

- [X] The replication package contains one or more programs to install all dependencies and set up the necessary directory structure.

- **Stata** (code was last run with version 18)
  - `esttab` command (from `estout` package)
  
The packages are included in the `ado` directory. The `main.do` automatically sets the `adopath` to include this directory. The `setup.do` file documents how these were installed, and can be used to re-install them, if so desired (not suggested).

### Controlled Randomness

- [ ] Random seed is set at line _____ of program ______
- [ ] The analysis relies on random number generation, but setting a seed is not possible
- [X] No pseudo-random number generator is used in the analysis described here.

### Memory, Runtime, Storage Requirements

#### Summary time to reproduce

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard (2025) desktop machine:

- [x] <10 minutes
- [ ] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-2 hours
- [ ] 2-8 hours
- [ ] 8-24 hours
- [ ] 1-3 days
- [ ] 3-14 days
- [ ] > 14 days

#### Summary of required storage space

Approximate storage space needed:

- [x] < 25 MBytes
- [ ] 25 MB - 250 MB
- [ ] 250 MB - 2 GB
- [ ] 2 GB - 25 GB
- [ ] 25 GB - 250 GB
- [ ] > 250 GB

#### Computational Details

The code was last run on a **standard desktop machine with MacOS with an internet connection and at least 100MB of free space**.

## Description of Programs/Code

The replication package contains four Stata do-files:

1. **setup.do**: Documents how the environment is configured; does not need to be executed if the `ado`-path from the replication package is used.
2. **`main.do`**: Master file that creates required folders, runs all programs in sequence and creates a log file
3. **`code/download_raw_data.do`**: Downloads raw unemployment and CPI data from FRED and saves them as Stata datasets in `data/raw/`
4. **`code/create_analysis_data.do`**: Merges the raw datasets, calculates year-over-year inflation rates, formats dates, and creates the final analysis dataset
5. **`code/analyze_data.do`**: Produces the scatterplot with fitted line and runs the regression analysis

All results are automatically saved to the appropriate directories (`results/figures/`, `results/tables/`, and `results/log/`).

### License for Code

## Instructions to Replicators

### Directory Structure

The replication package expects the following directory structure (folders will be created automatically if they do not exist):

```
.
├── code/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── analysis/
└── results/
    ├── figures/
    ├── log/
    └── tables/
```

### Replication Steps

1. Ensure you have Stata 18 or higher installed
2. Ensure you have an active internet connection (required to download data from FRED)
3. Open Stata with the working directory in the replication package root folder
4. Run `do "main.do"`

The master file will:
- Download the raw data from FRED
- Process and merge the data
- Generate the figure and regression table
- Create a log file documenting all steps
